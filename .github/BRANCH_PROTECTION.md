# 🔒 Branch Protection Configuration

This document provides the recommended GitHub branch protection settings for implementing **Phase 2 Week 4** of the deployment roadmap.

## 🎯 Configuration Overview

Configure branch protection rules for the main branches to ensure code quality and prevent broken deployments.

## 🚀 Branch Protection Settings

### For `main` branch:

#### Required Settings
```
✅ Require a pull request before merging
  └── ✅ Require approvals: 1
  └── ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  └── ✅ Require review from code owners (optional)

✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
  └── ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  └── ✅ Required status checks:
      - Essential Tests (Required) [ci.yml]
      - test / Run Tests (Node 18) [test.yml] (optional)

✅ Require conversation resolution before merging

✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB

✅ Allow force pushes: ❌ Disabled
✅ Allow deletions: ❌ Disabled
```

### For `feature/dev-prod-environments` branch:

#### Required Settings  
```
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
  └── ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  └── ✅ Required status checks:
      - Essential Tests (Required) [ci.yml]

✅ Allow force pushes: ✅ Enabled (for development)
✅ Allow deletions: ❌ Disabled
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Access Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Navigate to **Branches** in the left sidebar

### 2. Add Branch Protection Rule for `main`
1. Click **Add rule**  
2. **Branch name pattern**: `main`
3. Configure settings as shown above
4. Click **Create**

### 3. Add Branch Protection Rule for Development
1. Click **Add rule**
2. **Branch name pattern**: `feature/dev-prod-environments`
3. Configure settings as shown above  
4. Click **Create**

## 🧪 Testing Branch Protection

After configuration, test the rules:

```bash
# 1. Try pushing directly to main (should be blocked)
git checkout main
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: direct push"
git push origin main
# Expected: ❌ Push blocked by branch protection

# 2. Create PR workflow (should work)
git checkout feature/dev-prod-environments
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: workflow trigger"
git push origin feature/dev-prod-environments
# Expected: ✅ Push succeeds, GitHub Actions triggered

# 3. Create PR from feature branch to main
# Expected: ✅ PR created, status checks required
```

## 📊 Status Check Requirements

### Essential Checks (Must Pass)
- **Essential Tests (Required)**: All 35+ tests from `ci.yml`
- **Duration**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Failure Action**: Blocks merge until fixed

### Optional Checks (Informational)  
- **Code Quality**: Formatting, linting (from `ci.yml`)
- **Multi-Node Testing**: Node 18 & 20 compatibility (from `test.yml`)
- **Security Audit**: Vulnerability scanning
- **Failure Action**: Warnings only, doesn't block merge

## 🛠️ Repository Owner Actions

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. ✅ Apply branch protection rules as documented above
2. ✅ Test workflow with small dummy commit  
3. ✅ Verify status checks appear in PR interface
4. ✅ Configure any missing secrets for Cloudflare (optional)

### Secrets Configuration (Optional for Build Check):
```
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: [Your Cloudflare Account ID]
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: [Your Cloudflare API Token]
```

### Rollback Plan:
If branch protection causes issues:
1. Disable specific rules temporarily
2. Fix underlying workflow issues
3. Re-enable protection rules
4. Test with small commits

## 🎯 Success Validation

After configuration, you should see:
- ✅ Direct pushes to `main` blocked
- ✅ PRs require status checks to pass  
- ✅ GitHub Actions run automatically on push/PR
- ✅ Status checks visible in PR interface
- ✅ Merge button disabled until checks pass

## 📈 Phase 2 Week 4 Completion Criteria

- ✅ Branch protection rules configured
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows active
- ✅ Status checks enforced for merges  
- ✅ Development team can see automated test results
- ✅ Ready for Phase 2 Week 5: Automated Dev Deployment
